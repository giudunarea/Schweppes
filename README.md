## Welcome to the Astro Project Github Page 🌐!

Our mission is to make the best educational platform on the market, using the most reliable tools. We hope for a better tommorow, where online classes do not replace the offline alternative, but instead co-exist with each other.

## Why did we chose open-source 🎓?

Open-source projects give birth to creativity and freedom. We would be hipocrites if we fought for a better education for everyone, but do not let anybody study our code, wouldn't we?
Moreover, this lets any school to setup the Astro Project free of charge.

## How do I setup the Astro Project 🛠️?
  
Depends on your needs! We have fully documented in the <b>setup.md</b> file. Before you dive into it though, you will need some software installed:

    1)XAMPP (for MySQL , Apache and PHP)
    2)Our project (of course)
    3)A text editor.
